Welcome to Day 7! Today, weâ€™re exploring **inheritance**â€”a key concept in Java that lets you build new classes based on existing ones. Itâ€™s like taking a great blueprint and adding some extra features to make it even better. Letâ€™s dive in!

Imagine you have a basic robot blueprint (class) that has some cool features. Now, you want to create a new type of robot that has all the features of the basic one, plus some extra abilities. Instead of starting from scratch, you use inheritance to build on the existing blueprint.

In Java, **inheritance** allows one class (called a **subclass** or **child class**) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (called a **superclass** or **parent class**). This helps you reuse code and create more specialized classes.

Letâ€™s start with a simple superclass named Animal:

**Whatâ€™s Inside?**

*   **String name;**: Property for the animalâ€™s name.
*   **void eat()**: Method that prints a message when the animal eats.

Now, letâ€™s create a subclass named Dog that inherits from Animal:

**Whatâ€™s Happening?**

*   **Dog extends Animal**: This line means that Dog is a subclass of Animal. It inherits all the properties and methods from Animal.
*   **String breed;**: A new property specific to Dog.
*   **void bark()**: A new method specific to Dog.

1.  **Code Reuse:** You can reuse code from the superclass, so you donâ€™t need to rewrite it.
2.  **Organization:** It helps you organize your classes in a hierarchy.
3.  **Flexibility:** You can create more specialized classes that build on existing ones.

## <img src = "https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/huge-basic-icons-part-3/512/Java.png" align = "left" width = "30"> Overriding Methods

Sometimes, you might want to change how a method works in a subclass. This is called **overriding**. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

*   **@Override**: This annotation tells Java that youâ€™re changing the behavior of the eat method in the Dog class.

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll dive into **polymorphism**â€”a concept that allows objects to act in multiple ways depending on their type. Itâ€™s like having a universal remote that can control different devices!

Great job today! Youâ€™re mastering some of the coolest features of Java. Keep goingâ€”youâ€™re getting closer to being a Java expert! ðŸš€
