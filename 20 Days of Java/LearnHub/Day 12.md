<div align="center"><h1>Day 12 - File Fun: Storing and Fetching Data!</h1></div>

Welcome to Day 12! Today, weâ€™re learning about **file handling** â€” a cool way to store information, save data, and even read from files in Java. Imagine youâ€™re writing in a notebook and then reading it laterâ€”thatâ€™s what file handling is like in programming. Letâ€™s discover how to manage files with your Java code!

1.  **Data Storage:** Store information permanently, like saving game progress or keeping a record of data.
2.  **Read User Input:** Load settings or configurations from a file.
3.  **Logging:** Keep track of important events in your program (like errors or actions).

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll jump into **collections and data structures**â€”a key part of Java that lets you manage groups of data in efficient ways. Itâ€™s like learning how to organize your toys so you can find them easily!

Awesome work today! File handling opens up so many possibilities for saving and loading data in your programs. Keep up the amazing progressâ€”youâ€™re doing great! ðŸš€
