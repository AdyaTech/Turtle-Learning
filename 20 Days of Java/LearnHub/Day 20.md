<div align="center"><h1>Day 20 - The Grand Finale: Mastering Collections and Streams!</h1></div>

Welcome to Day 20, the final day of your Java journey! Today, weâ€™re diving into one of the most powerful features in Java: **collections and streams**. These tools let you handle large groups of data easily, whether itâ€™s a list of items, a map of key-value pairs, or filtering and transforming data using streams. Think of collections as well-organized containers and streams as smart pipelines that process data. Letâ€™s get started!

1.  **Organize Data:** Store and manage data in lists, sets, and maps.
2.  **Efficient Data Processing:** Easily perform operations like sorting, filtering, and mapping.
3.  **Real-World Use:** Collections are used everywhere, from storing user data to processing large datasets.

Java provides a rich set of collection interfaces like List, Set, and Map for handling data:

*   **List**: An ordered collection that allows duplicates (e.g., ArrayList).
*   **Set**: A collection that doesnâ€™t allow duplicates (e.g., HashSet).
*   **Map**: Stores key-value pairs (e.g., HashMap).

Streams let you process collections in a clean, functional way. Instead of writing loops, you can use methods like filter(), map(), and forEach():

1.  **Data Handling:** Collections and streams are essential for working with data in any application.
2.  **Clean Code:** Streams allow you to process data in a concise and readable way.
3.  **Industry Standard:** Collections and streams are used in almost every Java application, from web development to data analysis.
