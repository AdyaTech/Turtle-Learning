Welcome to Day 8! Today, we‚Äôre exploring **polymorphism** ‚Äî a powerful concept that lets objects take on many forms and perform different actions depending on their type. It‚Äôs like having a magic tool that can adapt to various tasks. Let‚Äôs dive into the magic of polymorphism!

Polymorphism means ‚Äúmany shapes‚Äù or ‚Äúmany forms.‚Äù In Java, it allows objects to use methods in different ways based on their specific type. This concept helps you write more flexible and reusable code.

1.  **Method Overloading:** Using the same method name but with different parameters.
2.  **Method Overriding:** Changing the behavior of a method inherited from a superclass.

**Method Overloading**

Method overloading means you can have multiple methods with the same name, as long as they have different parameters (different types or numbers of inputs).

**Method Overriding**

Method overriding happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows subclasses to change the behavior of methods inherited from the parent class.

1.  **Flexibility:** You can use the same method name for different purposes, making your code more flexible and easier to manage.
2.  **Reusability:** It helps you write code that can work with objects of different types in a uniform way.
3.  **Extensibility:** You can add new classes with new behaviors without changing existing code.

Tomorrow, we‚Äôll explore **abstract classes** ‚Äî a way to create classes that can‚Äôt be instantiated directly but provide a base for other classes to build upon. It‚Äôs like setting up a template for other classes to follow!

Fantastic work today! Polymorphism is a powerful tool in Java that makes your code more dynamic and adaptable. Keep going strong‚Äîyou‚Äôre making amazing progress! üöÄ
