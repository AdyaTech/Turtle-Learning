<div align="center"><h1>Day 13 - Collecting Coolness: Data Structures & Collections!</h1></div>

Welcome to Day 13! Today, weâ€™re diving into **collections and data structures**â€”the tools that help you organize, store, and manage groups of data. Imagine you have a box of toys: some are sorted by type, some are in piles, and others are in neat rows. Data structures and collections do the same for your data! Letâ€™s explore how they work in Java.

A **collection** is simply a container that holds multiple elements, usually of the same type. Java provides a collection framework that includes popular data structures like lists, sets, and maps, each with its own special powers!

1.  **List:** Like a row of items, where each item has an index (position). Think of it like a to-do list.
2.  **Set:** Like a bag where no duplicates are allowedâ€”each item is unique.
3.  **Map:** Like a dictionary where you look up values using keys.

One of the most common collections is the ArrayList. Itâ€™s like a resizable array that can grow or shrink as needed.

1.  **Flexible Storage:** Collections like ArrayList can grow and shrink as needed.
2.  **Fast Searching:** Maps allow quick lookups based on keys.
3.  **Data Organization:** Lists, sets, and maps help organize data efficiently.

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll take a look at **generics** â€” a powerful feature that lets you create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with any data type. Itâ€™s like making one-size-fits-all tools for your code!

Great job today! Collections are an essential part of Java that make managing data a breeze. Keep up the amazing workâ€”youâ€™re doing awesome! ðŸš€
