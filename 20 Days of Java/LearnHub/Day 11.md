<div align="center"><h1>Day 11 - Exception Expedition: Catching Code Crashes!</h1></div>

Welcome to Day 11! Today, weâ€™re diving into **exception handling**â€”a safety mechanism that helps your programs deal with errors gracefully. Imagine youâ€™re riding a bike, and you hit a bump. Exception handling is like having shock absorbers that smooth out the ride instead of letting you crash. Letâ€™s learn how to handle unexpected bumps in your Java code!

An **exception** is an event that disrupts the normal flow of your program. Itâ€™s like an error or unexpected situation that can cause your program to stop running. Java provides tools to handle these exceptions so your program doesnâ€™t crash.

1.  **Checked Exceptions:** Exceptions that are checked at compile-time (e.g., IOException).
2.  **Unchecked Exceptions:** Exceptions that occur at runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException).

Java uses the try, catch, and finally blocks to handle exceptions. Letâ€™s break it down:

*   **try Block:** The code that might cause an exception goes here.
*   **catch Block:** If an exception happens, this block catches it and runs specific code to handle it.
*   **finally Block (Optional):** Code that always runs, whether an exception happens or not.

1.  **Prevent Crashes:** Handling exceptions prevents your program from crashing unexpectedly.
2.  **Improve User Experience:** You can show helpful error messages instead of letting your program just stop.
3.  **Maintain Code Flow:** Exception handling helps keep your program running smoothly, even when things go wrong.

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll explore **file handling**â€”a way to read from and write to files in Java. Itâ€™s like learning how to keep a digital diary using code!

Fantastic job today! Exception handling is an essential skill that makes your code more robust and user-friendly. Youâ€™re getting closer to mastering Javaâ€”keep up the awesome work! ðŸš€
