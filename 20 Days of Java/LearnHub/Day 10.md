<div align="center"><h1>Day 10 - Interface Intelligence: Connecting the Dots!</h1></div>

Welcome to Day 10! Today, we’re diving into **interfaces** — a powerful feature in Java that lets you define a set of rules (methods) that other classes must follow. If abstract classes are blueprints, interfaces are like contracts that say, “If you sign this, you agree to provide these specific methods.” Let’s explore how interfaces work!

An **interface** in Java is a collection of abstract methods (and sometimes constants) that any class implementing the interface must define. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces allow multiple classes to implement them, even if those classes are unrelated.

1.  **Multiple Inheritance:** A class can implement multiple interfaces but can only extend one abstract class.
2.  **All Methods are Abstract:** Interfaces only have abstract methods by default (Java 8 introduced default methods).
3.  **No Constructor:** Interfaces can’t have constructors since you can’t create objects from them directly.

1.  **Flexible Design:** Interfaces let you design systems that are loosely coupled and more flexible.
2.  **Multiple Inheritance:** Interfaces allow classes to inherit behaviors from multiple sources.
3.  **Standardization:** Interfaces help set a common standard that different classes can follow.

Tomorrow, we’ll explore **exception handling** — a way to deal with errors and unexpected situations in your code. It’s like having a safety net that catches problems before they crash your program.

Awesome work today! Interfaces are a crucial part of Java programming that helps you design flexible and maintainable code. Keep up the great progress—you’re doing fantastic! 🚀
