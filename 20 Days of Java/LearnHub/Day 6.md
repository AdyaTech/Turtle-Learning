<div align="center"><h1>Day 6 - Class Act: Object-Oriented Basics!</h1></div>

Welcome back! Today, we’re diving into **classes** and **objects**—the heart of Java’s object-oriented programming. This might sound like big words, but it’s all about organizing and managing your code in a smart way. Let’s get started!

Imagine you’re building a robot. You first need a blueprint to know how the robot will look and what it can do. In Java, a **class** is like that blueprint—it defines the properties (like color, size) and actions (like walk, talk) for your objects.

An **object** is like an actual robot built from that blueprint. Each object has its own unique features but follows the same basic design.

Let’s start by making a simple class for a **Car**:

**What’s Inside?**

*   **String color;**: This is a property that holds the color of the car.
*   **void drive()**: This is a method that makes the car “drive.” You can define what happens when you call this method.

Once you have your **Car** class, you can create objects from it:

**What’s Happening?**

*   **Car myCar = new Car();**: This line creates a new car object using the Car class. You can create as many cars as you want!
*   **myCar.color = "Red";**: You’re setting the color of your myCar object to red.
*   **myCar.drive();**: This tells Java to execute the drive method for the myCar object.

Classes and objects help you organize and manage your code better. They let you:

*   **Encapsulate**: Keep related data and methods together.
*   **Reuse**: Create multiple objects with the same blueprint but different properties.
*   **Simplify**: Break down complex programs into smaller, manageable pieces.

A **constructor** is a special method that’s called when you create a new object. It helps set up initial values for the object’s properties.

Tomorrow, we’ll explore **inheritance**—a way to create new classes based on existing ones. It’s like making new blueprints from old ones, adding extra features or tweaking things as needed.

You’re doing fantastic! Keep exploring classes and objects—these are the building blocks for creating powerful and organized code. 🚀
