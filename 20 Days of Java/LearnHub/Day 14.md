<div align="center"><h1>Day 14 - Generics Genius: One Code Fits All!</h1></div>

Welcome to Day 14! Todayâ€™s journey takes us into the world of **generics**â€”a powerful feature in Java that lets you write code that works with different data types. Think of generics as creating a mold that can shape many different objects without changing the mold itself. Letâ€™s explore how generics make your code flexible and reusable!

Generics allow you to define classes, methods, and interfaces that work with any type of data. Instead of writing different code for each data type, generics let you create one template that can handle various types like String, Integer, or even custom objects!

1.  **Code Reusability:** Write a single class or method that works for all types.
2.  **Type Safety:** Generics ensure that only the correct data type is used, reducing errors.
3.  **Flexibility:** Use generics for any data type, from basic types like int to complex objects.

1.  **Cleaner Code:** You donâ€™t need to write the same logic multiple times for different data types.
2.  **Fewer Errors:** Generics provide compile-time checks, preventing you from using the wrong data type.
3.  **Increased Flexibility:** You can build reusable and adaptable code that works with a variety of types.

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll learn about **threads and multitasking**â€”the way Java lets you run multiple things at once, like listening to music while typing. Itâ€™s all about making your programs smarter and faster!


Youâ€™re doing fantastic! Generics are a crucial skill that make your Java programs more flexible and error-free. Keep it up, youâ€™re a coding superstar! ðŸš€
