<div align="center"><h1>Day 16 - Error Busting: Conquering Exceptions Like a Pro!</h1></div>

Welcome to Day 16! Today‚Äôs adventure is all about **exceptions and error handling**‚Äîthe safety nets that keep your program from crashing when things go wrong. Imagine you‚Äôre playing a video game, and you suddenly hit a wall. Without error handling, your game might just freeze or shut down. But with the right techniques, you can keep going smoothly. Let‚Äôs explore how Java helps you handle those unexpected errors!

An **exception** is an event that disrupts the normal flow of your program. It‚Äôs like a red flag saying, ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs not right!‚Äù For example, dividing by zero, accessing an invalid array index, or trying to open a file that doesn‚Äôt exist can all trigger exceptions.

1.  **Checked Exceptions:** These are checked at compile-time (like file not found). You must handle them in your code.
2.  **Unchecked Exceptions:** These are usually programming errors (like dividing by zero) and are checked at runtime.
3.  **Errors:** These are serious problems like running out of memory and usually can‚Äôt be fixed by the program.

The main way to catch and handle exceptions is with a try-catch block.

Sometimes, you want to make sure certain code runs whether an exception occurs or not. That‚Äôs where the finally block comes in:

1.  **Smooth Program Flow:** Handle unexpected issues without crashing your program.
2.  **User-Friendly:** Provide helpful error messages and keep your program running.
3.  **Reliability:** Make your code more robust and trustworthy.

Tomorrow, we‚Äôll explore **file handling** in Java. We‚Äôll learn how to read from and write to files‚Äîan essential skill for working with data in your programs.

Great job today! Understanding exceptions and error handling is key to writing solid code that works well even when things go wrong. You‚Äôre doing amazing‚Äîkeep it up, and happy coding! üöÄ
