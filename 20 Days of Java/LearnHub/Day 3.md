<div align="center"><h1>Day 3 - Operator Overload: Playing with Expressions!</h1></div>

You’re back! Today is all about **operators** — the tools that help you make things happen with your variables. Think of them as magic wands that let you add, compare, or even mix data together.

Operators are symbols that tell Java to do something with your variables. Imagine them as action words like “add,” “multiply,” or “compare.” We have different types of operators for different tasks.

These operators let you do basic math:

*   **\+ (Addition):** Adds two numbers together.
*   **\- (Subtraction):** Subtracts one number from another.
*   **\* (Multiplication):** Multiplies numbers.
*   **/ (Division):** Divides one number by another.
*   **% (Modulus):** Gives the remainder after dividing two numbers (like when you divide 5 by 2, the remainder is 1).

**Example:**

These operators let you compare numbers or values:

*   **\== (Equal to):** Checks if two values are the same.
*   **!= (Not equal to):** Checks if two values are different.
*   **\> (Greater than):** Checks if the first value is bigger.
*   **< (Less than):** Checks if the first value is smaller.
*   **\>= (Greater than or equal to):** Checks if the first value is bigger or equal.
*   **<= (Less than or equal to):** Checks if the first value is smaller or equal.

**Example:**

## <img src = "https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/huge-basic-icons-part-3/512/Java.png" align = "left" width = "30"> Logical Operators: Combining Conditions!

Sometimes you want to check more than one thing at a time. Logical operators help with that:

*   **&& (AND):** Both conditions must be true.
*   **|| (OR):** At least one condition must be true.
*   **! (NOT):** Reverses the condition (true becomes false, false becomes true).

**Example:**

Operators let you do cool stuff with your data! Whether it’s basic math or checking conditions, they’re the tools that make your programs smart and interactive.

Tomorrow, we’ll dive into methods — where you’ll learn about tiny helpers that do any specific tasks you want them to execute.You’ll be controlling your code like a pro!

Great job today! Keep exploring and playing with your code—it’s the best way to learn. 🚀
