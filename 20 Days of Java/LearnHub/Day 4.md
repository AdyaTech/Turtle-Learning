<div align="center"><h1>Day 4 - Method to the Madness: Functions Unleashed!</h1></div>

You’re doing great so far! Today, we’re going to unlock one of the most powerful tools in programming — **methods**. Think of methods as tiny helpers that do specific tasks whenever you need them. Let’s jump in!

Imagine you’re building a robot that can do a lot of different things: make a sandwich, dance, and even tell jokes. But instead of writing the instructions for every task over and over, you can create methods! Each method is like a set of instructions for one task.

In Java, methods help us organize our code into neat, reusable blocks.

1.  **Reusability:** Once you write a method, you can use it as many times as you want without rewriting the code.
2.  **Organization:** Methods make your code cleaner and easier to understand.
3.  **Flexibility:** You can give a method different inputs to get different results.

Let’s start simple by making a method that says “Hello!”

## <img src = "https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/huge-basic-icons-part-3/512/Java.png" align = "left" width = "30"> What’s Happening?

*   **public static void sayHello() {**: This line defines a method named sayHello. The word void means this method doesn’t return any value—it just does something.
*   **System.out.println("Hello, Java learner!");**: This line is the task the method performs.
*   **sayHello();**: We’re telling Java to run (or "call") the sayHello method. You can call it anytime you need that message!

What if you want to greet different people? Instead of making a new method for each name, you can give your method inputs, called **parameters**.

## <img src = "https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/huge-basic-icons-part-3/512/Java.png" align = "left" width = "30"> What’s New?

*   **String name**: This is a parameter. It’s a placeholder for whatever name you want to pass when calling the method.
*   Now, the method is more flexible—it can greet anyone based on the input!

Sometimes, you want your method to not just do something, but also give you back a value. Let’s say you want to add two numbers and get the result:

Here’s how it works:

*   **int addNumbers(int a, int b)**: This method takes two numbers as inputs and returns an integer (int) value.
*   **return sum;**: This line gives the result back to where the method was called.
*   **int result = addNumbers(5, 7);**: The result of adding 5 and 7 is stored in result, which we then print.

Methods let you break down big problems into smaller, easy-to-handle tasks. Imagine you’re building a huge game—using methods means you can organize everything neatly, making your life as a coder way easier.

Tomorrow, we’ll dive into **arrays**, which let you store multiple values (like a list of numbers) in a single variable. It’s a powerful way to handle lots of data at once!

You’re on a roll! Keep coding and practicing—every day, you’re getting closer to becoming a Java whiz! 🚀
